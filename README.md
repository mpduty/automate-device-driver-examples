# This is an automated test suit for Linux device driver examples by Shakthi Kannan
# You may find a fork of the same in https://www.github.com/mpduty/linux-device-driver-examples .
# The test suit contains only one shell script file.
# To run the script you copy-paste the test.sh into the root of the directory of linux-device-driver-examples
# Then cd into the directory from the terminal and run the command 'sh test.sh' (without quotes)
# The test suit will run through all the examples, run Makefiles and test if the modules can be loaded/removed properly
# Currently the test suit only works up to example 5
# I have tested the test suit on a self configured Linux kernel (version 4.9.11)
# It is recommended to use a secondary system for running the tests.
